# Python Population Simulator
 A simulation of population changes using Python, DearPyGui, and NumPy

The goal of this python project is to create an application that can help show the dynamics of population growth of a certain population given parameters by the user. With things like population density and disease taken into some account, the base model is a population curve with population growth taken into account vs population death. The basics of the system would then expand to printing graphs to visualized the change in the population dynamics.

![GUI Example]()

As of now, the code is officially in 0.3. The Features added so far are just basic user input sliders and storing of data. Heres the next few plans!

*Population Calculations based on growth rate typing
*Charts to help visualized the change done
*Disease and Natural Disasters effects and notation on the Chart to help visualized what has happened!
*Export/Importing CSV files
*Additional parameters like chance of twins, population density positive effects

At the end, the plan for the program is to have it be a [b]realistic[/b] representation of how real life populations work and grow in python with a GUI to boot.
